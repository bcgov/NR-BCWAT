                Estimates of water supply represent long-term average conditions. These estimates were generated from hydrology models. The models incorporate information about climate, terrain, land cover, evapotranspiration, watershed boundaries and connectivity, and observed hydrology, and are calibrated using long-term streamflow monitoring data collected by the Water Survey of Canada, United States Geological Survey, and other organizations. Detailed information on models and performance is provided in the methods section of this report. Environmental flow needs calculations identify the amount of water rivers require to maintain healthy aquatic ecosystems. The calculations presented in this report are based on the Province of BC's Environmental Flow Needs Policy

            <p>Water allocations represent existing water rights and are sourced directly from government databases. These allocations include both short-term (temporary diversion) and long-term licences at the time of licence extract as noted within the report. Volumes of water indicated as consumptive use associated with these allocations are summarized and integrated with the estimates of water supply to provide a complete picture of the resource. Licences for all purposes are included. Both surface water and groundwater allocations within the watershed have been summarized. In some cases, assumptions have been made around timing of use (e.g. agriculture) where that information is not explicitly supplied with the source data. Information on all licences are included in this report along with notes indicating any assumptions made.</p>
